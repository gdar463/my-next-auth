# my-next-auth

My shot at an auth platform with next

## TODO

- [x] [Add social login](#social-login)
- [x] Rework login & register pages
- [ ] Add oauth through this app (maybe if I don't know what to do)

## Social login

- [x] Google
- [x] Discord
- [x] Github
- [x] Gitlab
- [ ] Microsoft (maybe if I don't know what to do) (next next next)
- [ ] Facebook (maybe if I don't know what to do) (dead last)
- [ ] Apple (if god gives me the will to give them 100 euros every year till I die, then (maybe maybe))
